# DD_MW
Dynamic Document for Minimum Wage Policy Estimates in the US.


The goal is to provide a completely transparent and reproducible version of the policy analysis regarding the effects of raising the minimum wage in the US. Our starting point is the 2014 report from the Congressional Budget Office on the issue.
